# BookRecommenderSystem
System that recommends new books to users. For Advanced Data Mining, SJSU 2021

Experiment with different recommender systems:

1. SVD Matrix Factorization Systems
2. User-based collaborative filtering
3. Item-based collaborative filtering

The dataset has 65,053 user-to-book ratings on a scale of 1-10. Each method was tested and RMSEs between
approaches compared to pick the best method. The final system was tested on a set of 100,000 unseen
user and book pairings then submitted to a Kaggle competition for evaluation.
